Thus, we wanted to see if there was a correlation between counties and the number of hospitals accross the United States. \n",

    "The two sets of data that we are working with are from different years. This is because the census is only updated every 10 years. Thus, the data we received for the population from the United States census is relatively older than the data we acquired for the hospitals. The data on the hospitals were received from the various state departments and federal resources which are updated often so it may not be missing hospitals. \n",
    "\n",
    "Biases in our data sources or analyses that may influence our interpretations are that some counties may have other hospitals close by in a neighboring county if there are lower populations in that particular county. Thus, they feel like they do not need to have a hospital in their city. Another bias would be urban areas versus rural area since there is a bigger population of people living in urban areas than rural. Also, the number of hospitals do not represent the number of people using the hospitals. The size of the hospital are also not taken into account from our data of the hospitals because less amount of hospitals does not mean that less people are being served.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our methods do not work or our hypotheses are wrong, then we will reflect on our mistakes and change the category of the data that we are looking at. Like for example instead of the ratio between the number of hospitals and the population of the county, we could change the two variables that we are comparing to receive a more accurate conclusion."
